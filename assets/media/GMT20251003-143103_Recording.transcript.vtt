00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:05.799
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: Well, let's see how to use a location finder.

2
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:12.079
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: Now, here, starting off the file, we'll have two A sheet here?

3
00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.549
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: One is proximity checker, and another one is address to coordinates.

4
00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:22.330
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: How it will work here is, you have to enter the address, the name.

5
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.479
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: landed email and phone details here. Then.

6
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:32.889
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: I have highlighted the full address, so please do not touch it, since it has a formula here.

7
00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.389
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: And we have to enter city, state, zip code.

8
00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.620
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: Once, after entering all this information.

9
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:48.670
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: the geo-latitude, longitude information should pop up, but I have removed the formula here.

10
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.849
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: Because it'll take a long time to work, and at the same time.

11
00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.319
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: If you're planning to use it.

12
00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.139
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: Please use it, like, use the formula.

13
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.540
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: And then you'll get the coordinates after that.

14
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.430
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: Please copy and paste as values so that

15
00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.670
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: If you keep on piling it up.

16
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.809
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: It'll take a lot of time for the Excel to load.

17
00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.859
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: So I would always recommend copy, and then paste as values.

18
00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.439
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: So that it will not take much time, and it will not hang your Excel.

19
00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.500
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: So, once you've entered the information, It will automatically give us

20
00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:34.510
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: What is the nearest school distance in feet? And also the nearest school name.

21
00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:41.240
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: And here, It'll give you the nearest hospital, And also.

22
00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:47.150
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: Here, now it is giving the recreation type of the school district which we are taking here.

23
00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.690
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: And then, the nearest hospital. And what is the availability?

24
00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.250
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: And the safe distance means whether…

25
00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.960
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: The school district, which we are seeing, is

26
00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.419
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: Greater than 500 feet or not.

27
00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.120
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: So, based on it, it'll automatically tell us

28
00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:14.310
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: Whether it's safe for us to consider for the Participants?

29
00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:20.959
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: So that they can be… they'll be placed, like, more than 500 feet from the nearest school.

30
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.669
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: And the school type will also come over here.

31
00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.899
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: And if you want, you can even filter it, like.

32
00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:33.850
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: Just click on Save, so it'll clearly tell us that which locations are safe for us, not safe, so these are the…

33
00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.319
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: Locations which we need to be

34
00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:43.989
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: Clearly ensure that, you know, we can play… we are placing the right candidate at the particular accommodation.

35
00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.739

36
00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:59.800
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: The school district's names, and also the hospital names, which you are seeing here, they're not automatically coming.

37
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:06.590
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: If they're coming, because I've created a database here, You can see that schools.

38
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.690
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: So, I pulled this data from…

39
00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.610
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: If we can see here the data sources.

40
00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:21.439
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: So this is the place where I was able to get this data. So in future, I would always recommend

41
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.130
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: To go through these resources, other links?

42
