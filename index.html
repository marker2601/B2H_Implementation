Covers referral prerequisites (form, reason, expected LOS, special needs), supervisor approval, vendor setup (hotels/motels, SROs, congregate, specialized units) with vendor code, agreement, W-9/ACH. Stay limits default to ≤90 days; extensions require supervisor justification. Check-in cadence varies by setting (e.g., hotels: ≥3x/week with ≥1 in-person), with notes entered within 24h. Incident response: vendors call 24/7 hotline; life-threatening → 911 + CM/supervisor; all incidents logged in ECR with follow-up plan. Invoicing: monthly template, CM verifies occupancy, finance pays within 30 days; discrepancies are resolved with vendor/CM. Transition/exit requires a plan within 30 days (target permanent option, supports), final inspection, and ECR closure.
