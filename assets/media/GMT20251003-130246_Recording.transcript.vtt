00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:03.040
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: Hi.

2
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:08.019
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: So, the client budget calculator, it's an easy-to-access store.

3
00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:20.890
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: So, wherein, by just plugging the numbers, we'll be able to get to know, like, how many participants we can afford for this particular project. Now, here you will see, like, 4 tabs.

4
00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.900
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: One is assumptions.

5
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.120
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: Second is simulator.

6
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.139
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: On the calculator, Then, staff detailing.

7
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:36.260
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: So, in staff detailing, Where we'll be giving the… designation?

8
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:42.939
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: And the FT, as per the project, And their annual salary?

9
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:50.699
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: And the fringe benefits… Then it'll automatically calculate the total value here.

10
00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.500
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: And this is a baseline which we have considered for each.

11
00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.940
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: designation here.

12
00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.350
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: mouth.

13
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.640
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: What happens here is.

14
00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:09.910
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: Once we update these details, these details will get updated over here into the staff cost directly.

15
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:19.460
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: Now, whenever, if there is any change in a position, or if you want to add any position, you can add or remove here.

16
00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:25.809
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: And you can just update the effort and annual salary, so it will automatically calculate.

17
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.790
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: I'll enter door here.

18
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.150
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: When it comes to the simulator.

19
00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:38.509
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: This is where the values will be auto-populated from there, so the background calculation, which is happening here.

20
00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:52.429
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: And please change the details as it is necessary, based on the project, and if it… when insurance increases, decreases. So all we need to do is update the details.

21
00:01:52.880 --> 00:02:00.229
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: As you can see here, this is linked to the assumptions, because other direct costs are taken from here.

22
00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.940
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: Which we can see that how even it is calculated by the logic.

23
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:14.079
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: So it is pretty straightforward from here. So once, if you want to update direct costs, go to Assumptions and Update.

24
00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.870
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: And if you want the position details to get updated, updating staffing detail.

25
00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.459
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: Then, it will calculate the total amounts here.

26
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.439
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: And it'll give you the amount which we need.

27
00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.220
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: Or, which is gonna be spent for this particular project.

28
00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.810
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: So here, we can see the indirect rate and the participants are highlighted.

29
00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.250
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: Why? Because?

30
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.400
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: We can change these values.

31
00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:47.690
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: Let's say if you want to check for… let's say… around 100 participants.

32
00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.219
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: So, I'll get to know this count. And…

33
00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:58.369
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: Since we have already given the base training here, based on that base training, it will automatically calculate.

34
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.580
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: How many staff is required to complete the project?

35
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.250
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: And the star detailing also will change, vice versa, based on it.

36
00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:14.600
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: And even we can change the indirect rate, like, 25%, 20%.

37
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.499
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: So, basically, we can change the data as we need it.

38
00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.970
Jagadeesh Kumar Gorla: So this is how the client budget calculator works.
